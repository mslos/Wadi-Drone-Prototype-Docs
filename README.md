## About this documentation

Wadi Drone was a prototype of a "data mule" (**M**obile **U**biquitous **L**AN **E**xtension), created by an undergraduate research group at NYU Abu Dhabi. This documentation captures many lessons that we learned in creating our prototype (for example work with XBees, Sleepy Pi platform and Raspberry Pi). It includes graphics that we created for your inspiration. We would like to share this knowledge with the world since much of the work was based on open source hardware and software. 

Wadi Drone transmission system can work with any platform that supports Pixhawk flight controller, whether it is a plane or a quadcopter. The prototype is essentially a box that could be loaded on any aerial platform and work as a data mule. All the tutorials are available under MIT License without any guarantees.
